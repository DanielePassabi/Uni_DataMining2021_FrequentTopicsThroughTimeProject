# How to execute the program

---

## Prerequisites 

1) Installation of `Python 3.8.5` or more
2) For the program to run correctly, it is necessary to install some libraries:
    - `pandas 1.2.1`
    - `mlxtend 0.18.0`

    It is recommended to create a virtual environment for the project, where to install the required libraries. 
    
    To install the libraries, open the command prompt and activate your virtual environment. You can install the libraries in two ways:
    - using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
    (once you have navigated to the `executable` directory)
    - using `pip install name_of_library`

## Execution with .py script

1) Download the source project folder `Daniele Passab√¨ 221229`

2) Open the command prompt and navigate to the `executable` directory. Here, you will find a script named `program.py`

3) Run the `.py` script: in the command prompt the command is the following `python program.py arg`
    - `arg` is the external parameter to be passed to the script via the command line. It represents the number of itemsets we want the solution to return, so it **must** be a number. If you want all possible itemsets, enter 0.

    Example: `python program.py 50` will return the 50 most frequent itemset in time, based on the total number of dates in which the itemset is present.

## Notes 
- The program takes as input the cleaned dataset, which is found in `data/clean_df/clean_df.pkl`. 

  It is possible to use this program with other datasets than the one given, if they respect the following input format:
   - the dataset must have the column `date`, with dates in it
   - the dataset must have the column `text`, with list of words in it
   - the dataset must be in `.pkl` format, to preserve the properties of the variables
- The results of the APriori algorithm can be found in `data/results/results_df_exec.pkl` (or `data/results/results_df_exec.csv`)
